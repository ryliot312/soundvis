         <p class="mb-3 pb-3 border-bottom border-3"> This project asks the question "Can you build the illusion of a 3-dimensional space using only sound?". The target user for this project is really anyone who is interested in immersing themselves in a fully auditory space. We will take a medium-sized room, and using camera sensors, such as an Xbox Kinect Sensor, we will map out the room using a coordinate system. This way, the Kinect can sense where a person is moving throughout the room, and exact coordinates as to where. We will use Wwise or FMOD to create a fully dynamic soundscape in the room, with different pinpointed sounds at different locations in the room, using the coordinate system of the kinect. Bluetooth headphones will be applied to the user, so they can walk around the room freely without a change in the audio input signal. Ideally, the room would be a whiteout room, as to not give any visual context clues as to where they are. The essential experience is for someone to experience a reality in which sound is their only source of direct sensory input. The changing soundscape will make it feel as if the user is walking into different rooms, buildings, and scenes, all while staying in the same room. Pinpointed sounds will act as curiosities for users to find and pinpoint themselves. We want to explore the true depth of what creating a fully acoustic environment could look (rather, sound) like. </p>
